**_PELT_ has been removed!**

Github has announced [Community Guidelines regarding "What is not allowed"](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/#what-is-not-allowed) which state:

	Active malware or exploits - Being part of a community includes not taking
	advantage of other members of the community. We do not allow anyone to use our
	platform for exploit delivery, such as hosting malicious executables, or as
	attack infrastructure, for example by organizing denial of service attacks or
	managing command and control servers. Note, however, that we do not prohibit
	the posting of source code which could be used to develop malware or exploits,
	as the publication and distribution of such source code has educational value
	and provides a net benefit to the security community.

As _PELT_ was a repository for the pre-built binaries for my various tools, _PELT_ has been removed. The source code for the _PELT_ tools can still be found in my other Github repositories.
